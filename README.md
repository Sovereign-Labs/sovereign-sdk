## What is Sovereign?

The Sovereign SDK is a free and open-source toolkit for building zk-rollups **that is currently under development**. 
This monorepo contains the SDK and, for boring development reasons, several of its dependencies. To get started, 
look at the contents of the [`sdk`](sdk) folder

## How does it work?

To learn how the Sovereign SDK works, see the ![Sovereign SDK Overview](sdk/specs/overview.md).

## Warning

The Sovereign SDK is a research prototype. It has not been audited and should not be used in production under any
circumstances.
